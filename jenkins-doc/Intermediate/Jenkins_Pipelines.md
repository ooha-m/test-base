## Overview
Jenkins Pipeline is a workflow with group of tasks that brings code from version control system or scripted pipeline into provide the good software to customers or end users in a automated way.
- Pipeline offers a extensible set of tools for modeling simple to complex delivery **pipeline as a code** via *Domain Specific Language* (DSL).

#### what is Jenkinsfile
Jenkins Pipeline is written into text file called **Jenkinsfile**. which you can commit to your project source code repository.
##### Jenkins Pipeline is supported in two types of syntax:
-  [Declarative Pipeline](#what-is-declarative-pipeline)
-  [Scripted Pipeline](#what-is-scripted-pipeline)
#### Pipeline Concepts
- The following concepts are fundamental of jenkins pipeline
-  **Pipeline**: A pipeline is a user-defined model of a Continuous Delivery. A Pipelineâ€™s code defines your entire build process, which includes stages for build, test and deliver the application. It is a part of Declarative pipeline.
-  **Node**: A node is a machine on which jenkins runs. node block is mainly used in scripted pipeline.
-  **Stage**: A stage contains a series of tasks performed through entire pipeline, that is, build, test, and deploy processes all come together in a stage. A stage block can visualize your jenkins pipeline status.
-  **Step**: A step is nothing but a single task that executes a specific process at a particular point of time. This block is used in Declarative pipeline.
#### what is Declarative Pipeline
Declarative Pipeline bring a simple and user friendly syntax with some specific statements. without learn groovy. Declarative pipeline should be start with *pipeline* sentence and follow the required sections:
- agent
- stages
- stage
- steps  

sample Declarative Pipeline example:-
``` groovy
pipeline {
	agent any
		stages {
			stage('stage1') {
				steps {
					// stage1 steps
				}
			}
			stage('stage2') {
				steps {
					// stage2 steps
				}
			}
			stage('stage3') {
				steps {
					// stage3 steps
				}
			}
		}
	}
```

#### what is Scripted Pipeline
Scripted Pipeline provides a flexibility and extensibility to jenkins users. it starts with a *node*
sample Scripted Pipeline example:-
``` groovy
node{
     stage('stage1') {
		// stage1 steps
     }
     stage('stage2') {
		// stage2 steps
     }
     stage('stage3') {
	  	// stage3 steps
     }
     
}
```
- Both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline are DSLs to describe a piece of your software delivery pipeline. Scripted Pipeline is written in a limited form of Groovy syntax.
- A Pipeline can be created in two ways:

-  __Classic UI__ you can enter pipeline directly in Jenkins UI.

-  __SCM__ Source Code Management you can write a Jenkinsfile manually and commit into you project source code repository.

## Pre-Requisites
Before using Jenkins Pipeline we need following requirements.
- jenkins 2.x or later version.
- pipeline and github plugin, which is a part of **suggested plugins**
## Practice 1: Basic Jenkins Pipeline
### 1.1 Declarative Pipeline with Classic UI
steps to create sample pipeline in classic UI
1. Click **New Item** in the top left corner on the dashboard.  
![new_item](/Intermediate/img/new_item.png?token=AJU3VUWRXBECK5O6APPDX6246UFXA)  
2. Enter the name of your project in the **Enter an item name** field, and select **Pipeline** project , and click **OK** button .
e.g: pipeline_project_1
![pipeline_name](/Intermediate/img/entername.png?token=AJU3VUXI5YTZ4TFNFMFDCXC43ZNA6)
3. Next Enter the **description** if you want.
4. Go to pipeline section, **Definition** field indicates Pipeline script option.
![definition](/Intermediate/img/definition.png?token=AJU3VUX6XPHGPUF5XEA66DK43ZNKW)
5. write your pipeline code into script area.
6. In this lab we are going to explain declarative pipeline. select **pipeline script** in **definition** field.
- For example:-
copy and paste the following declarative pipeline example into script area.
``` groovy
pipeline {
	agent any
		stages {
			stage('stage1') {
				steps {
					sh '''echo stage1 steps'''
				}
			}
			stage('stage2') {
				steps {
					sh '''echo stage2 steps'''
				}
			}
			stage('stage3') {
				steps {
					sh '''echo stage3 steps'''
				}
			}	
		}
	}

```
![script_area](/Intermediate/img/pipeline_script.png?token=AJU3VUUR3ECCZLQV3ND5MW243ZNMY)
7. Finally click on **Apply** and **Save**. it will redirect to pipeline view page.
8. Click **Build Now** button to execute your pipeline.
![build_now](/Intermediate/img/build_now.png?token=AJU3VUQNQQYXJX5CYWJIQOK43ZNPW)
9. After pipeline execution is completed the pipeline view will be **below** screenshot.
![pipeline_view](/Intermediate/img/pipeline_view.png?token=AJU3VUWSEHRP2M4FBCJHDFC43ZNSM)
10. We can verify the history of executed build by clicking the build number e.g: **#1**
11. Click on build number and select **console output**
![console_output](/Intermediate/img/console_output.png?token=AJU3VUSW4OQVG7TAGE5XCQC43ZNUM)
